The program reads data from this directory every time it runs trials. If you're having trouble with the program, feel free to delete the files associated with the troubled deck.

deckname-results.txt is a human-readable (and program-readable) database of past results from trials of the deck.
deckname-cached.txt is a decklist; it makes sure that the deck we are running is the same one we ran results for before so we don't mix results together.
